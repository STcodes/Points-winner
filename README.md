# Points-winner
Multiplayer game

This game prefers to play with two players
Rules:
1: The first who got 100 points will win.
2: When you roll 1, your current score will reset and it will be the next player turn.
3: When you click Hold, then it will update your score and it will be the next player turn. (why not risking ;p)
